# mysql-and-node-store
Homework Ten: This project involved "creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store."


## Technologies Used
This project involved the following technologies
- node.js
- javascript
- MySQL
- node libraries including inquirer, mysql, and cli-table

## Getting Started

If you want to try out the application for yourself:

### Prerequisities (to try this locally)

What to install and how

```
- pull this repository to your computer
- because I created the package.json file, in your bash simply navigate to where you pulled the repository and type: npm install
- this will install the node_modules required
```

## Review of the code
For Project presentation, you can include snippets of code you found buggy, interesting, or are overall proud of here.  Try to limit the quantity and size to quick readable bits.

```
function awesomeThing() {
    //...
    // try not to make it too long otherwise, point to filepaths:line numbers
    //...
}
```
